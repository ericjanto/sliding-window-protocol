# Sliding Window Protocol Experiments
This project implemented and analysed various protocols for end-to-end reliable data transfer at the application layer over the [user datagram protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).

In particular, three different [sliding window protocols](https://github.com/ericjanto/sliding-window-protocol#sliding-window-protocol-concept) were implemented: Stop-and-Wait, Go-back-N, and Selective Repeat.

[tc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html) was used to simulate specific network conditions to allow for reproducible results.
